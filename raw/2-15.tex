Continuing with both affine and projective varieties, we generalize the notion of morphism to that of rational map:  given irreducible varieties $V,W$ a {\sl rational map} $\pi$ from $V$ to $W$ is a morphism from a nonempty open subset $U$ of $V$ to $W$, with two such defined on open subsets $U,U'$ being identified if they agree on the intersection $U\cap U'$.  Thus a rational map differs from a morphism in that it need not be everywhere defined; in fact the restriction of any morphism to any open subset of its domain is a rational map.  Note that the notion of rational map and the related notions below have no counterparts in manifold theory; a crucial point here is that nonempty open subsets of irreducible varieties, unlike those of manifolds, are always dense.  A rational map from $V$ to $W$ is called {\sl dominant} if its range is dense in $W$; note that this property does not change if the map is replaced by an equivalent one.  Dominant rational maps from a variety $V$ to another one $W$ correspond bijectively to homomorphisms $K(W)\rightarrow K(V)$ of their rational function fields.  If two rational maps $\pi:V\rightarrow W$ and $\phi:W\rightarrow V$ are such that their composition in either order is identified with the identity map, then we say that $V$ and $W$ are {\sl birationally equivalent} or just {\sl birational}.  The simplest example of a pair of nonisomorphic birational varieties is an old friend from last week, namely the affine variety $V$ defined by the equation $x^2 = y^3$ in $K^2$ and the affine line $K^1$; here the respective coordinate rings are $K[x,y]/(x^2 - y^3)\cong K[t^3,t^2]$ and $K[t]$.  As you saw in homework last week, these rings are not isomorphic and accordingly $V$ is not isomorphic to $K^1$, but the rings become isomorphic after each is localized by powers of $t$.  Correspondingly we have a birational map from $K^1$ to $V$ defined on $K^*$ by sending $t$ to the pair $(t^3,t^2)$; its inverse is defined on the complement $C$ of the origin in $V$ by sending $(x,y)$ to $y/x$; this is a legitimate morphism on $C$ because its coordinate ring picks up the function $x^{-1}$ that was not present in $K[V]$.  In fact $C$ is isomorphic as a variety to $K^*$, and indeed two varieties are birational if and only if they have isomorphic open subsets, or equivalently if and only if they ave isomorphic rational function fields; in particular $K^n$ and $\Bbb P^n$ are birational.  Assuming for simplicity that the field $K$ has characteristic 0 (though the following result holds in general), we know that the rational function field $K(V)$ of any variety (affine, quasi-affine, projective, or quasi-projective, the last denoting the intersection of a projective variety and an open subset of projective space) is finitely generated as a field extension of $K$, so that there are finitely many elements $x_1\ldots,x_n$ of $K(V)$ that are algebraically independent over $K$ and $K(V)$ is a finite extension of the rational function field $K_n=K(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.  By the Primitive Element Theorem from Galois theory, there is a single element $y$ generating $K(V)$ as a $K_n$-algebra; if $p$ is its minimal polynomial over $K_n$, then we can clear denominators in $p$ to get a single irreducible polynomial $q$ in $n+1$ variables over $K$ such that $q(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y) = 0$ and then our variety $V$ is birational to the affine hypersurface in $K^{n+1}$ defined by the equation $q=0$.  

We now want to extend a basic notion from manifold theory to algebraic geometry, namely the definition of tangent space to a variety at a point.  Let $V\subset K^n$ be any affine variety, $v$ a point of $V$, and $M_v$ the maximal ideal of the coordinate ring $K[V]$ corresponding to the point $v$.  Then the {\sl tangent space} $T_v(V)$ of $V$ at $v$ is the dual of the $K$-vector space
$M_v/M_v^2$; that is, it consists of the $K$-linear maps from the quotient $M_v/M_v^2$ to $K\cong K[V]/M_v$.  (This definition parallels one you have seen or will see shortly in manifolds.)  Recall that a morphism $f$ from $V$ to another affine variety $W$ induces a $K$-algebra homomorphism
$f^*:K[W]\rightarrow K[V]$ mapping $M_{f(v)}\subset K[W]$ for $v\in V$ to $M_v$, thus also
$M_{f(v)}^2$ to $M_v^2$.  It follows that $f^*$ induces a $K$-linear map called the {\sl differential} of $f$ and denoted by $df$ from $T_v(V)$ to $T_f(v) W$ (exactly as in manifolds).  Now it turns out that we can compute the dimension of the tangent space $T_v(V)$ of $V$ at $v$ in the same way as we would for manifolds.  Let $I$ be the ideal of $V$, generated by the polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_m$.  Form the Jacobian matrix $J_v$ whose $ij$-th entry is the partial derivative $\partial x_i/\partial  x_j$ evaluated at $v$ (computed via the usual formal rules; we do not need limits).  {\sl Then the corank of this matrix (that is, $n$ minus its rank), equals the dimension of $T_v(V)$}; in particular, the corank of $J_v$ does not depend on the choice of generators of $I$.  To see this, observe that the map sending any $f\in S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ to its gradient evaluated at $v$ vanishes on $M^2$ (by the product rule), where $M$ is the maximal ideal of $S$ corresponding to $v$.  It induces a vector space isomorphism between $M/M^2$ and $K^n$.  Its value on a linear combination of the $f_i$ is a $K$-linear combination of the rows of $J_v$ (whose coefficients are those of the original linear combination evaluated at $v$).  Hence the corank of $J_v$ matches the dimension of $T_v(V)$, as desired.  Now this corank will generically (more precisely, on an open set, defined by the nonvanishing of one of a finite collection of determinants) take a certain value; we call such points
{\sl regular} or {\sl nonsingular}. At other points, called {\sl singular} it will take a higher value.  Thus {\sl the dimension of $T_v(V)$ takes a certain value on the set of regular points of $V$, a nonempty open set, and a higher value elsewhere}.  It is natural to expect (and correct) that this value is none other than the dimension of $V$ itself (assuming $V$ is irreducible).  We will prove this next time and then digress to discuss the notion of dimension in a more general context.For now, we mention a couple of examples.  The variety $V\subset K^2$ with equation $x^2 - y^3 = 0$ has exactly one singular point, at $(0,0)$; there the tangent space is two-dimensional, while it is one-dimensional elsewhere.  Similarly, the variety $W\subset K^3$ defined by $xz - y^2 = 0$ has exactly one singular point, at the origin.  The {\sl projective} variety defined by the same equation has no singular points, as $(0,0)$ is not a point in $\Bbb P^2$, and indeed we have observed that this last variety is isomorphic to $\Bbb P^1$.
