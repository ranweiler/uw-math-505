\noindent 1. Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring.  Show that the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is Noetherian.  (You must show that every nonzero ideal $I$ of $R[x]$ is finitely generated; given $I$, let $L$ consist of all leading coefficients of all nonzero elements of $I$.  Show that $L$ is an ideal of $R$; if it is generated by the leading terms $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of the polynomials $p_1,\ldots,p_n\in I$, then show that $I$ is the sum of $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ and the intersection $J$ of $I$ with the set of polynomials in $R[x]$ of degree at most $N$, where $N$ is the maximum of the degrees of the $p_i$.  Finally, show that $J$ is an $R$-submodule of a free $R$-module of finite rank, so is finitely generated already as an $R$-module.).  Deduce that the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ in any finite number of variables over a field $K$ is Noetherian.

\noindent 2. Similarly show that the power series ring $R[[x]]$ is Noetherian whenever $R$ is; arguing similarly to the previous problem, except that $L$ consists of the nonzero coefficients of the
{\sl lowest} power of $x$ in any nonzero element of $I$.

\noindent 3. Let $p$ be a prime number and $q$ a monic polynomial in $\Bbb Z_p[x]$ that has a root of multiplicity one in $\Bbb Z_p$.  Show that $q$ also has a root in the $p$-adic integers.

\noindent 4. Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and $V$ the subvariety of $K^2$ of zeros of the single polynomial $xy - 1$.  Exhibit the coordinate ring $K[V]$ as an integral extension of a suitable polynomial ring over $K$ and write down the corresponding morphism realizing $V$ as a ramified finite cover of the affine line $K^1$.  What are the sizes of the fibers of this morphism?

\noindent 5. Again let $K$ be algebraically closed and let $W$ be the variety of zeros in $K^2$ of the single polynomial $x^2 - y^3$.  Exhibit a morphism from the affine line $K^1$ onto $W$ that is bijective, but whose inverse is not a morphism (since the associated algebra homomorphism from $K[W]$ to $K[K^1]= K[x]$ is not an isomorphism.)
