We now introduce a new kind of variety, significantly different from an affine variety.  The motivation is that (despite the Nullstellensatz) affine $n$-space $K^n$ is not large enough to solve problems involving polynomials in a uniform way; we need to add certain points at infinity.  More precisely, start with the coordinate ring $S = K[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ of $K^{n+1}$ and observe (as mentioned last quarter) that $S = \oplus_m S_m$ is a graded ring, where $S_m$ consists of all homogeneous polynomials in $S$ of (total) degree $m$.  If $p\in S$, write $p_m$ for its homogeneous component of degree $m$, so that for example $(x^2 y + x y^2 + xy)_3 = x^2 y + x y^2$.  Call an ideal $I$ of $S$ {\sl homogeneous} or {\sl graded} if it is the direct sum of its projections $I_m$ to $S_m$ for $m\ge0$.  The variety $V$ of such an ideal will then be a {\sl cone}, that is, it will contain $kv$ for any $k\in K$ whenever it contains $v)\in K^n$.  We now define a new space $\Bbb P^n$, called {\sl projective $n$-space}, which many of you will already have seen in manifolds; it is obtained from $K^{n+1}$ by deleting the origin and identifying $v\in K^{n+1},v\ne0$ with $kv$ for $k\in K,k\ne0$.  Given a homogeneous polynomial in $S$, it does not make sense to evaluate it at an element $v$ of $\Bbb P^n$, but it does make sense to ask whether or not it vanishes there.  Accordingly, given a radical homogeneous ideal $I\ne(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1})$ of $S$, we define its (projective) variety $V$ as the set of its common zeros in $P^n$, relying on context to distinguish between varieties in $K^{n+1}$ and those in $\Bbb P^n$; we have to omit the ideal $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1})$ since its only common zero is the origin, which has been deleted from $\Bbb P^n$.  (This ideal is therefore sometimes called the irrelevant ideal.)  Then the Nullstellensatz and a simple Vandermonde determinant argument establish the {\sl homogeneous Nullstellensatz}, which states the map $I\rightarrow V(I)$ sets up a 1-1 inclusion-reversing correspondence between relevant radical homogeneous ideals in $S$ and projective varieties; we also extend the Zariski topology to $\Bbb P^n$ by decreeing that the closed sets are exactly the projective varieties $V(I)$ of relevant homogeneous ideals $I$.  (Note that the radical of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous, and that a homogeneous ideal $I$ is prime if and only if it contains one of the factors $f$ or $g$ of a product $fg$ of homogeneous polynomials whenever it contains this product).  Every projective variety $V=V(I)$ has a {\sl homogeneous coordinate ring} $S/I$ attached to it, but now the elements of $S/I$ are not well-defined functions on $V$.  Nevertheless the ratio $f/g$ of nonzero homogeneous polynomials in $S/I$ of the same degree {\sl is} well defined as a function on $V$; the $K$-algebra consisting of all such ratios is called the {\sl rational function field} $K(V)$ of $V$, if $V$ is irreducible in the usual sense that $I$ is prime.  (If $V$ is irreducible and affine rather than projective, then we use the same notation $K(V)$ and the same name \lq\lq rational function field" for the full quotient field of the coordinate ring $K[v]$.)

Now a point $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1})$ in $\Bbb P^n$ with $x_1\ne0$ is equivalent to a unique point
$(1,y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ for some $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\in K^n$; note that $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ can even be the origin.  Hence there is a (principal) open subset $U_1$ of $\Bbb P^n$ and a natural bijection
$\phi_1$ between it and affine $n$-space $K^n$; even before we have defined the notion of morphism on a projective variety in general, we decree that $\phi_1$ is an isomorphism of varieties and the subring $K[x_2/x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}/x_1]$ of the quotient field of $S$ is the coordinate ring $K[U_1]$ of $U_1$.  In a similar manner, we define the affine open subset $U_i$ of $\Bbb P^n$ as the set of nonzeros of the coordinate function $x_i$ for $1\le i\le n+1$; its coordinate ring $K[U_i]$ is the subring $K[x_1/x_i,\ldots,x_{n+1}/x_i]$ of the quotient field of $S$.  Then a morphism between projective subvarieties $V,W$ of $\Bbb P^n,\Bbb P^m$, respectively, is a Zariski-continuous map $\pi$ from $V$ to $W$ such that the restriction of $\pi$ to each affine open subset $V\cap U_i$ of $V$ maps it into the affine open subset $W\cap U_j$ of $W$ for some $j$ and is a morphism of affine varieties when so restricted.  Thus such morphisms, unlike those between affine varieties, need not be given by a uniform formula (valid over all of $V$).  The simplest example is the subvariety $V$ of
$\Bbb P^2$ defined by the homogeneous equation $xz - y^2 = 0$.  A point on this variety takes the form $(a^2,ab,b^2)$ with $a,b\in K^2, a,b$ not both 0, and $a$ and $b$ unique up to multiplication by the same nonzero scalar.  We can map this point to $(a^2,ab)\in\Bbb P^1$ if $a\ne0$ and to
$(ab,b^2)\in\Bbb P^1$ if $b\ne0$; note that these formulas agree in $\Bbb P^1$ whenever both are defined.  This map is then an isomorphism from $V$ to $\Bbb P^1$; its inverse sends
$(a,b)\in\Bbb P^1$ to $(a^2,ab,b^2)$.   Note also that the homogeneous coordinate rings $K[x,y]$ and $K[x^2,xy,y^2]\subset K[x,y]$ of $\Bbb P^1$ and $\V$ are {\sl not} isomorphic, although their rational function fields ({\sl not} the same as their quotient fields) are isomorphic.

Thus $\Bbb P^n$ can be thought of as the overlapping union of $n+1$ copies of $K^n$.  It can also be thought of as the disjoint union of copies of $K^n,K^{n-1},\ldots,K^0$, by letting $Z_i$ be the complement of $U_i$ and then taking the affine varieties $U_1,Z_1\cap U_2, Z_1\cap Z_2\cap U_3$, and so on.  Thus the copies of $K^{n-1},\ldots,K^0$ consist exactly of the points \lq\lq at infinity" that one must add to $K^n$ to get $\Bbb P^n$.
