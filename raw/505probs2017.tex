\bigskip
\noindent 1. Let $E\supset F$ be a Galois extension of degree 6.  What
are the possibilities for the Galois group $G$ of $E$ over $F$?  For each
such possibility, determine the number of intermediate fields between
$E$ and $F$ and work out the correspondence between intermediate fields and subgroups of $G$ explicitly.
\bigskip
\noindent 2. Sketch the classification of finite fields.  When is a
finite field a Galois extension of one of its subfields?
\bigskip
\noindent 3. How can one modify the ring $\Bbb Z[\sqrt{-3}]$ slightly to make it a Dedekind domain?
\bigskip
\noindent 4. Determine all quotients of $\Bbb C[x,y,z]$ that are fields.
\bigskip
\noindent 5. Show that affine space $K^n$ and projective space $\Bbb P^n$ are not homeomorphic for $n>2$ (repeat of HW problem).
\bigskip
\noindent 6. Define the integral closure of an integral domain $A$ (in its quotient field $K$).
\bigskip
\noindent 7. Classify the prime ideals in the power series ring $K[[x]]$ for any field $K$.
\bigskip
\noindent 8. Define the strict transform (or blowup) of an affine variety.
