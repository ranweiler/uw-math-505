Continuing, we recall that $A$ is a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal $M$ and residue field
$K=A/M$ and $N$ is a finitely generated $A$-module.  We saw last time that the lengths of the respective quotients $A/M^n,N/M^nN$ as $A$-modules are polynomials $p_A,p_N$ of the respective degrees $d(A),d(N)$ for sufficiently large $n$ and that these degrees are unchanged if the power $M^n,M^nN$ are replaced respectively by the ideal $Q^n,N_n$, where $Q$ lies between some power $M^k$ of $M$ and  $M$ itself and the sequence $F=(N_n)$ is a stable $Q$-filtration of $N$.  We also saw that $d(A)$ is bounded above by $s$ whenever $M$ (or $Q$) is generated by $s$ elements.  Now let $N'$ be a submodule of $N$ and define a $Q$-filtration $(N_n')$ of $N'$ via
 $N_n'=N'\cap N_n$.  Form a new graded ring $B_Q(A) = \oplus_{i\ge0}  Q^i$, called the {\sl blowup of $A$ at $Q$}, for which multiplication of $x\in Q^i,y\in Q^j$ is defined as usual, putting the product in the $i+j$th graded piece $Q^{i+j}$.  Similarly define $B_F(N), the blowup of $N$ at $F=(N_n)$, to be $\oplus_{i\ge0} N_i$; since $N_n$ is a $Q$-filtration, $B_F(N)$ becomes a graded $B_Q(A)$-module in a natural way.  It is finitely generated, by any set of generators of
$N_0\oplus N_1oplus\ldots\oplus N_i$, where $i$ is chosen large enough so that $N_{n+1} = QN_n$ for $n\ge i$.  Now we have an increasing chain of submodules $S_i$ of $B_F(N')$ defined via
$S_i =N_0' \oplus\ldots\oplus N_i'\oplus QN_i'\oplus Q^2 N_i'\oplus\ldots$, which must terminate, forcing the induced $Q$-filtration $(N_n')$ of $N'$ to be stable.  Now let $x\in A, x$ not a zero-divisor in $N$.  Then $N' = xN\cong N$; setting $\bar{N} = N/xN$ and $N_n'=N'\cap Q^nN$ as above, we have an exact sequence
$0\rightarrow N'/N_n'\rightarrow N/Q^n N\rightarrow \bar{N}/Q^n \bar{N}\rightarrow 0$, whence
$p_N'(n) - p_N(n) + p_{\bar{N}}(n) = 0$ for all sufficiently large $n$.  Since $p_N',p_N$ have the same degree and leading term, we see that $p_{\bar{N}}$ has degree at most $d(N) - 1$.  In particular,
{\sl $d(A/(x))\le d(A) - 1$ if $A$ is Noetherian local and $x$ is not a zero-divisor in $A$}. Now we can show that {\sl $\dim A\le d(A)$ for any Noetherian local ring $A$}.  To prove this we need a very useful result called {\sl Nakayama's Lemma:  if $N$ is a finitely generated module over a local ring $A$ with $N=MN, M4 the maximal ideal of $A$, then $N = 0$}.  Indeed, note first that any $x\in A$ of the form $1+m$ for some $m\in M$ is a unit, since any non-unit lies in a maximal ideal, but no such $x$ can lie in $M$.  If $N$ is finitely generated but $N\ne0$, let $n_1,\ldots,n_r$ be a minimal set of generators; then we must have $n_1 = m_1 n_1 + \ldots + m_r n_r$ for some $m_i\in M$, whence we can divide by $1-m_1$ and solve for $m_1$ in terms of the remaining $m_i$, contradicting minimality of $m_1,\ldots,m_r$ as a generating set for $N$.  Next we prove $\dim A\le d(A)$ by induction on
$d(A)$.  If $d(A)=0$, then the length of $A/M^n$ is a constant for large enough $n$, forcing
$M^n = M^{n+1}$ for large $n$; since $M$ is finitely generated, Nakayama says that $M^n = 0; but then any prime ideal, containing 0, must contain $M$ and $M$ is the only prime ideal, implying that
$\dim A = 0$.  If $d=d(A)>0$ and $P_1\subset\cdots P_r$ is a strictly ascending chain of prime ideals in $A$, then choose $x\in P_1,x\notin P_0$, and let $x'$ be the image of $x$ in $A'=A/P_0$.  Then
$d(A'/(x')\le d(A') -1; but the unique maximal ideal $M'$ of $A'$ (the image of $M$) is such that
$A'/(M')^n$ is a homomorphic image of $A/M^n$ for all $n$, so that $d(A')\le d(A)$ and
$d(A'/(x'))\le d(A) - 1$.  Then the images of $P_1,\ldots,P_r$ form a strict chain of prime ideals in $A'$, whence $r\le d(A)$ and $\dim A\le d(A)$, as desired.  In particular, {\sl $\dim A$ is finite for any Noetherian local ring $A$},  Next, given any Noetherian local ring of dimension $d$, we saw last time how to construct $x_1,\ldots,x_d\in A$ such that the only prime ideal of $A$ containing the $x_i$ is $M$ (the unique prime ideal of height $d$), so {\sl $\dim A$\ge \delta(A)$, where $\delta(A)$ is the minimum number of generators of any primary ideal with radical $M$}.  Since the radical $r(I)$ of any ideal $I$ in $A$ is finitely generated, say by $x_1,\ldots,x_m$ with $x_i^{n_i}\in I$, we see that any product of $n_1+\ldots+ n_k$ combinations of the $x_i$ lies in $I$, so $I$ contains a power of its radical.  Hence {\sl the ideal $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ constructed above (where $d$ is the height of $M$), contains a power $M^k$ of $M$ and may be chosen as $Q$ in the recipes above for computing
$d(A)$.  We finally arrive at our central result:  {\sl for any Noetherian local ring $A$, we have
$d(A) = \dim A = \delta(A)$ and all three quantities are finite}.  In particular, if $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ with $K$ a field, then $\dim S = n$, since $d(S) = n$ (the Hilbert series of $S$ as a graded $S$-module is $(1-t)^{-n}$).  If $A = S/P$ with $P$ a prime ideal and if $x\in A,x\ne0$, then $x$ is not a zero-divisor in $A$, whence {\sl any minimal prime ideal over $(x)$ has height 1}.  If $K$ is algebraically closed, then this says that {\sl the intersection of an irreducible affine variety $V$ of dimension $d$ and a hypersurface $H$ not containing it has all irreducible components of dimension $d-1$}.  In fact, {\sl given any irreducible varieties $V,W$ in $K^n$ with $V\subset W$ and
$\dim V\le\dim W - 2$, there is an irreducible variety $V'$ strictly between $V$ and $W$ and having dimension one less than that of $W$}:  given the prime ideals $P_V,P_W$ of $V,W$, respectively, then $S/P_W$ has no zero divisors, so choose a nonzero $x$ lying in the image of $P_V$ in this quotient and look at a minimal prime ideal over $(x)$ contained in this image.  Hence {\al any two saturated chains of prime ideals in $S$, or of irreducible varieties in $K^n$, have the same length $n$}, as claimed previously; we also see for any irreducible variety $V$ that the dimension of the localization $K[V]_v$ of the coordinate ring $K[V}$ at any point $v\in V$ agrees with that of $V$.   Given any irreducible projective variety $V\subset P^n$, defined by the homogeneous ideal $I\in S$, its affine cone $C(V)\subset K^{n+1}$ (defined by the same ideal) has dimension one larger, since we can compute the dimension of $V$ as the maximum length of any strict chain $I\subset\cdots\subset I_d$ of homogeneous prime ideals in $S$ whose last term $I_d$ is necessarily properly contained in the irrelevant ideal $S'=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, and then construct a corresponding chain to compute $\dim C(V)$ by adding $S'$ to the first chain.
