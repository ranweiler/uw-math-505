\noindent 1. Let $M$ be a finitely generated torsion-free module over an integral domain $R$.  Show that $M$ is isomorphic to a finitely generated submodule of $R^n$ for some $n$, by first extending the construction of the quotient field $F$ of $R$ to embed $M$ in a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over $F$ and then arguing that there is a basis $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ of $V$ and an element $d$ of $R$ such that the image of $M$ in $V$ lies in the submodule generated by $(1/d)b_1,\ldots,(1/d)b_n$.

\noindent 2. Now let $R$ is a Dedekind domain.  Show that every nonzero ideal $I$ of $R$ is projective as an $R$-module, by arguing as in class that there is a nonzero ideal $J$ of $R$ such that $IJ=(b)$, a principal ideal in $R$, and that there are finitely many elements $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ in $I, y_1,\ldots,y_n$ in $J$, such that
$\sum x_i y_i = b$.  Then show that $I$ is isomorphic to a direct summand of $R^n$.

\noindent 3. If $R$ is a Dedekind domain, show that two direct sums $\oplus_{i=1}^r I_i,
\oplus_{j=1}^s J_j$ of ideals of $R$ are isomorphic as $R$-modules if and only if $r=s$ and the product $I_1\cdots I_r$ is in the same ideal class as $J_1\cdots J_s$.  (If the sums are isomorphic, argue that the isomorphism must be implemented by a necessarily square matrix $Q$ over the quotient field of $R$, whose determinant can be used to show that the products lie in the same ideal class.  For the converse, it is enough to show that if $I,J$ are nonzero ideals, then the sum $I\oplus J$ is isomorphic to $R\oplus IJ$.  Prove this directly if the ideals $I,J$ are coprime (with sum $R$) and use a result in class to reduce to this case.)

\noindent 4. Combining the results of the first three problems, show that a finitely generated torsion-free module $M$ over $R$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of ideals of $R$ and so is projective.

\noindent 5. Show that the extension $\Bbb Z(\sqrt{-3})$ of $\Bbb Z$ is {\sl not} a Dedekind domain.
