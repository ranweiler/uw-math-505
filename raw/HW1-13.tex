\noindent 1. Let $F$ be a finite field.  Show that $F$ has the structure of a finite-dimensional vector space over $\Bbb Z_p$ for some prime $p$ and deduce that the order of $F$ is $p^n$ for some positive integer $n$.
\vskip .5in
\noindent 2. Continuing, show that $F$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $x^{p^n} - x$ over
$\Bbb Z_p$.

\noindent 3.  Conversely, let $p^n$ be a power of a prime $p$.  We know that the map sending $x$ to $x^p$ defines a field homomorphism from any field $K$ of characteristic $p$ to itself.  Use this to show that the set $S$ of roots of the polynomial $x^{p^n} - x$ over $\Bbb Z_p$ inside the splitting field $F_n$ of this polynomial over $\Bbb Z_p$ itself forms a field, so that $S=F_n$.  Show also that all roots of this polynomial are distinct.  Finally, show that the Galois group of $F_n$ over $\Bbb Z_p$ is cyclic of order $n$.

\noindent 4. Now we know for every prime power $p^n$ there is a unique field $F_n$ up to isomorphism of order $p^n$.  Using the classification of finite abelian groups from last quarter, show that the multiplicative group $F_n^*$ of $F_n$ is cyclic.

\noindent 5. Deduce for any positive integer $m$ that there is an irreducible monic polynomial of degree $m$ over $F_n$.
