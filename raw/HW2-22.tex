\noindent 1. Let $C$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on the unit interval $[0,1]$ with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division defined pointwise.  Use the compactness of $[0,1]$ to show that the weak Nullstellensatz holds for $C$:  every proper ideal $I$ is such that its variety
$V(I)=\{x\in [0,1]:  f(x) = 0, f\in I\}$ is nonempty.  (On the other hand, the strong Nullstellensatz fails for $C$:  it admits nonmaximal ideals $I$ whose varieties reduce to a single point.)

\noindent 2. Show that the ring $C^{\infty}(\Bbb R)$ of infinitely differentiable real valued functions on $\Bbb R$ is not Noetherian,.  (Use the functions $f_a$ defined for $a\in \Bbb R$ by $f_a(x) = e^{-1/(x-a)^2}$ if $x\ne a$ while $f_a(a) = 0$; you may assume that all derivatives of $f_a$ are 0 at $a$).

\noindent 3. For $K$ an algebraically closed field let $V\subset K^3$ be the curve
$\{(t^3,t^4,t^5): t\in K\}$.  Show that $V$ is an irreducible affine subvariety of $K^3$ whose ideal $I$ is generated by the three elements $xz - y^2,x^2 y - z^2, x^3 - yz$ of $K[x,y,z]$.  Identify the coordinate ring $K[V]$ as a subring of $K[t]$.  Show that $I$ is not generated by any two elements of $K[x,y,z]$, by looking at the degrees of the terms of its elements.

\noindent 4. Show that any affine variety in $K^n$ is compact in the Zariski topology.

\noindent 5. Compute the intersection in $\Bbb P^3$ of the varieties defined by $x^2 - yw = 0$ and
$xy - zw = 0$ and show that this intersection is reducible.  Identify its components.
